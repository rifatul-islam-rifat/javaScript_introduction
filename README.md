# javaScriptIntroduction:
# JavaScript
# JavaScript (or "JS") is a programming language used most often for dynamic client-side scripts # on webpages, but it is also often used on the server-side, using a runtime such as Node.js, # Deno, and Bun.
# 
# JavaScript should not be confused with the Java programming language. Although "Java" and # "JavaScript" are trademarks (or registered trademarks) of Oracle in the U.S. and other # countries, the two programming languages are significantly different in their syntax, semantics, # and use cases.

# JavaScript is primarily used in the browser, enabling developers to manipulate webpage content # through the DOM, retrieve content from servers using the fetch() API, store complex data using # IndexedDB, draw graphics with canvas, interact with the device running the browser through # various APIs, and more. JavaScript is one of the world's most commonly-used languages, owing to # the recent growth and performance improvement of APIs available in browsers.

# Origins and History
# Conceived as a server-side language by Brendan Eich (then employed by the Netscape Corporation), # JavaScript soon came to Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995. JavaScript enjoyed immediate # success and Internet Explorer 3.0 introduced JavaScript support under the name JScript in August # 1996.

# In November 1996, Netscape began working with Ecma International to make JavaScript an industry # standard. Since then, the standardized JavaScript is called ECMAScript and specified under # ECMA-262, whose latest (fourteenth, ES2023) edition is available as of June 2023.

# Recently, JavaScript's popularity has expanded even further through the successful Node.js # platformâ€”the most popular cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment outside the browser. # Node.js - built using Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine - allows developers to use JavaScript as a # scripting language to automate things on a computer and build fully functional HTTP and # WebSockets servers.
